//! The [`PackStore`] async trait: the canonical interface for content-addressed
//! blob storage of pack archives in the personify workspace.

//! Import this module via the crate root re-exports:
//! `use personify_objects::{PackStore, ObjectHash, ObjectStoreError}`.

use crate::{ObjectHash, ObjectStoreError, ObjectStoreHealth};

/// Content-addressed blob store for pack archives.
///
/// Objects are addressed by their 32-byte [`ObjectHash`] (SHA-256 digest,
/// re-exported from `personify-pack`). The hash IS the address; no secondary
/// identifier is used.
///
/// # Contracts
///
/// - **Verify-on-write.** Implementations MUST verify that SHA-256(bytes) ==
///   supplied hash BEFORE persisting. Any mismatch returns
///   [`ObjectStoreError::HashMismatch`]. This is the only mechanism that
///   enforces the content-addressing invariant against caller bugs.
///
/// - **Idempotent `put`.** A `put` of an existing hash with MATCHING content
///   is a no-op success (`Ok(())`). A `put` of an existing hash with
///   DIFFERENT content (impossible if hashing is correct, but treated as
///   adversarial input) returns [`ObjectStoreError::HashMismatch`].
///
/// - **Concurrent `put` safety.** Two concurrent `put` calls for the same
///   (hash, bytes) pair MUST both return `Ok(())`; no `AlreadyExists`, no
///   data race.
///
/// - **Visibility atomicity.** After `put` returns `Ok(())`, a subsequent
///   `get` for the same hash from ANY task observes the full bytes.
///   Partial writes MUST NOT be observable; if a write is interrupted or the
///   quota is exceeded, no partial object becomes visible.
///
/// - **Verify-on-read** is OPTIONAL and adapter-configurable. Adapters that
///   enable it SHOULD return [`ObjectStoreError::BackendError`] if the stored
///   bytes do not match the key on read.
///
/// # Auth boundary
///
/// This trait DOES NOT enforce caller identity or pack signatures. The HTTP
/// server and signing layer verify authenticity before any `put` reaches the
/// store.
///
/// # Dyn-safety
///
/// The trait has no generic parameters and no `Self`-returning methods, so
/// it is usable as `dyn PackStore`. Wrap in `Arc<dyn PackStore>` for shared
/// ownership across tasks.
