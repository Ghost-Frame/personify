//! Tracing middleware configuration.
//!
//! Provides [`make_trace_layer`], which returns a
//! [`tower_http::trace::TraceLayer`] configured for the frameshift server.
//!
//! # Span fields
//!
//! Each HTTP request opens a span with the following fields:
//!
//! | Field | Value |
//! |---|---|
//! | `method` | HTTP method (GET, POST, ...) |
//! | `path` | Request URI path |
//! | `status` | HTTP response status code (filled on response) |
//! | `request_id` | UUID v4 from `x-request-id` (filled by request_id middleware) |
//!
//! # Privacy
//!
//! Request and response bodies are NEVER logged. Query strings are included in
//! `path` via the URI, which is intentional -- query params are not secret for
//! the read-only endpoints in this milestone. If a future endpoint carries
//! sensitive query params, the span configuration here MUST be adjusted.
